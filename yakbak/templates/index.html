    <h2>About {{ g.conference.full_name }}</h2>

    <p>
        {{ g.conference.full_name }} is taking place in November 16-19, 2019 in Toronto. It will feature three tracks of talks.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>

    <p>Our main goal is to strengthen the Canadian Python community by providing more opportunities for us to share knowledge and ideas, encourage support and education for speaking at conferences, and increase the visibility of developers, organizations, and companies within the community.</p>

    <p>PyCon Canada is entirely run by volunteers who are passionate about these goals. We hope to see you at the 2019 conference! We're also proud to host development sprints which provide a gateway for new contributors and a way for you to give back to the open-source community.</p>

    <h2>Who should submit? What topics are OK?</h2>

    <p>Anyone interested in speaking is encouraged to submit a proposal. There are no restrictions on topics, but we recommend they be of interest to Pythonistas. Talks will fill slots of 10 minutes and 25 minutes, including time for questions and answers.</p>

    <p>Everyone is encouraged to submit a proposal. We are looking for speakers of all different speaking and Python experience levels, from first-timers to experienced veterans.</p>

    <p>The audience’s experience level will be just as diverse, so feel free to cater your talk to a specific experience level.</p>

    <h3>Looking for Ideas?</h3>

    <p>One of the best ways to come up with an idea is to think about something you want to learn about. It’s a great way to learn about the topic and you’ll be able to share your experiences with the audience.</p>

    <p>Another great source of topics is challenges you’ve recently overcome. Did you recently use a unique profiler to identify a performance bottleneck? Perhaps you had to dive deep into a protocol or library and discovered something everyday users might not know. Experiences like these are usually full of great tips and tricks to share.</p>

    <p>Still looking for ideas? Here are some ideas to help get you started:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What’s new in web frameworks in 2019</li>
      <li>How to design software for safety and reliability</li>
      <li>Ethics of big data and software development</li>
      <li>Effective use of linters and other static analysis tools</li>
      <li>Recent changes to standard Python tools</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Also see the talks from <a href="https://2018.pycon.ca/schedule-day-1/">2018</a>, <a href="https://2017.pycon.ca/en/schedule/2017-11-18">2017</a>, and <a href="https://2016.pycon.ca/en/schedule/">2016</a> for ideas.</p>


    {% if g.user.is_anonymous %}
    <h2>OK, I'm sold!</h2>

    <p>
    Fantastic! If you have an idea, turning it into a proposal is a
    snap -- why not <a href="{{ url_for("views.create_talk") }}">submit
    a talk</a> right now?
